## Product Card Layout & Responsiveness

The product card layout typically features an image, product title, price, and action buttons (like "Add to Cart") arranged in a visually appealing manner.
Responsiveness is achieved using flexible CSS properties such as flexbox or grid, ensuring the card adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. On smaller devices, elements may stack vertically, images resize, and padding/margins adjust to maintain usability and readability.
This approach provides a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
